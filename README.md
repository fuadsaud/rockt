Rockt
=====

A stupid application launcher for Ruby.

## Usage

Just give it and URI, deadly simple:
  ```Rockt.launch('http://github.com') ```

This is going to open the system default web browser at "http://github.com"

## BEWARE: tested on OSX 10.8 only; (may not work in other OS's)

## TODO

- JRuby support
- Handle popular desktop environments (KDE, Gnome, Xfce, etc.)
- Test it on Windows/Cygwin
